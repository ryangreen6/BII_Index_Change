# Biodiversity Intactness Index Change in Phoenix Subdivision

## About: 

In this notebook, we will analyze the change in Biodiversity Intactness Index (BII) within the Phoenix Subdivision in Maricopa County, AZ, between 2017 and 2020, with the goal of identifying how urban growth has affected biodiversity in the region. 

## Highlights:

This workflow involves basic manipulation and plotting of shapefiles, importing and manipulating data from Microsoft's Planetary Computer, finding differences in raster data through algebra, and mapping spatial data. 

## Data:

The data for this workflow are stored in the data folder in this repository. Two major datasets are used:
- US Census TIGER/Line Shapefiles database. The US Census keeps updated datasets on many geographic divisions throughout the country, and in this workflow we will use the shapefile for County Subidivisions in Arizona[^1].

- BII Index Data. This data comes from Microsoft Planetary Computer's STAC Catalog, and was generated by Impact Observatory. This data can be loaded directly through Python, as done in this analysis. 

## Repository Structure:
The files housed in this repository are as follows:

- BII_Index_Change.ipynb
